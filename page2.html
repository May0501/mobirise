<div>Our Chinese nation has always been a flower-loving nation. In ancient Chinese characters, "Hua" and "Flower" mean flowers, and later they were gradually developed into commendatory words similar to glory and prosperity. Therefore, it is appropriate to compare the word "Hua Xia" to "the bloomer of flowers". Therefore, I choose solar terms and flowers to combine with the traditional Chinese medicine health theory.
